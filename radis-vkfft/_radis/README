This folder contains all files related to GPU calculations of RADIS spectra.
At the moment, only Nvidia cards are supported.

Nvidia uses CUDA for general purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming.
Most applications require the entire CUDA Toolkit installed in order to run.
Instead, RADIS interfaces directly with the CUDA GPU driver, and can therefore run without any additional installations.

The code that runs on the GPU is written in CUDA C and resides in the kernels.cu file.
The kernels.cu file must be re-compiled whenever it is modified by the developer (that is you!) and the output packaged with RADIS.
The CUDA driver loads the compiled .ptx file at runtime to launch the GPU kernels through driver.py.

In addition, RADIS kernels can be compiled to run on the CPU as a compatibility mode.
The kernels.cu file is compiled into kernels.dll (Windows) and kernels.so (Linux), which are
ran through emulate.py.

After modifying the kernels.cu file, it needs to be recompiled for the three targets (.ptx, .dll, .so).
Compiling to .ptx and .dll is done by running build_kernels.bat in a windows environment.
build_kernels.bat tries to run vcvarsall.bat, which may not have the proper path for your system.
You can edit the file in a text editor to provide the proper path to vcvarsall.bat.
The .so file is produced by compiling the .cu file in a linux environment by running ./build_kernels
